The *lineno* and *col_offset* attributes of the AST for decorated function
and class refer now to the position of the corresponding ``def``, ``async
def`` and ``class`` instead of the position of the first decorator. This
leads to more correct line reporting in tracing. This is the only case when
the position of child AST nodes can preceed the position of the parent AST
node.
